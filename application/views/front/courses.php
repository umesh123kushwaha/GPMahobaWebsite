                <p>Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering which includes the study of laws and principles of physics to analyze, maintain and design and manufacture mechanical systems. Mechanical engineers usually work in a variety of concepts related to thermodynamics, energy, kinematics and mechanics. This field of work is related to mechanical systems in various fields such as automobiles, manufacturing plants, cooling systems, machinery and industrial equipment to name a few. </p>
                <p>The mechanical engineering field equips students with the necessary knowledge about the working nature of heavy machinery and tools. They design almost everything which forms a base for industries to work and move ahead. Athletic equipment, medical devices, automobile engines, aircraft engines, batteries, air conditioners are just some of the products which are designed by mechanical engineers. There are numerous day to day usage equipment designed by mechanical engineers to help common men and their families live a great life with their inventions.</p>
